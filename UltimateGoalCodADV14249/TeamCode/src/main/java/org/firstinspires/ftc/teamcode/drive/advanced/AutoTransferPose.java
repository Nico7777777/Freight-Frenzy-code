/**
 * Example opmode demonstrating how to hand-off the pose from your autonomous opmode to your teleop
 * by passing the data through a static class.
 * <p>
 * This is required if you wish to read the pose from odometry in teleop and you run an autonomous
 * sequence prior. Without passing the data between each other, teleop isn't completely sure where
 * it starts.
 * <p>
 * This example runs the same paths used in the SplineTest tuning opmode. After the trajectory
 * following concludes, it simply sets the static value, `PoseStorage.currentPose`, to the latest
 * localizer reading.
 * However, this method is not foolproof. The most immediate problem is that the pose will not be
 * written to the static field if the opmode is stopped prematurely. To work around this issue, you
 * need to continually write the pose to the static field in an async trajectory follower. A simple
 * example of async trajectory following can be found at
 * https://www.learnroadrunner.com/advanced.html#async-following
 * A more advanced example of async following can be found in the AsyncFollowingFSM.java class.
 * <p>
 * The other edge-case issue you may want to cover is saving the pose value to disk by writing it
 * to a file in the event of an app crash. This way, the pose can be retrieved and set even if
 * something disastrous occurs. Such a sample has not been included.
